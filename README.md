# Game-of-Pong
The good old arcade game of pong recreated using Python Turtle Graphics. Move the paddles up and down to bounce the ball off the paddles. When ball isnt caught by paddle and goes out of bounds, gameboard resets, and score gets updated. As ball bounces off each paddle the speed of the ball increases, hence creating more of a challenge.
